# Markdown Exporter

Selecting the "Export to Markdown" option from the Journal Sidebar generates a ZIP file containing the selected journal/folder tree.

It is possible to export:

- one individual journal
- a folder of journals
- the entire sidebar of journals
- the contents of a Journal compendium
- the contents of Journal compendiums in a compendium folder

The contents of the downloaded ZIP can then be exported into your Obsidian Vault.

Links to non-journal entries will be converted to Markdown-format links (which will obviously point to non-existent pages).

## Options

### Format for non-decoded data

You can select either YAML or JSON for notes created from Actors and Items, to specify the format in which the data should be displayed within the note.

### Format Scenes for Leaflet plugin

All scenes will be converted to use the syntax required for Obsidian's "Leaflet" plugin.

### JournalEntry folders use UUID instead of Journal name

When not checked, folders will use the journal entry's name; when checked, folders will use the journal entry's UUID.

(Note that Obsidian's "AidenLX's Folder Note" plugin will show the journal's title in the note explorer.)

*Using UUID allows for easier (and more unique) linking of links between documents.*

### Use UUID of each document as the Note name

With this option checked, all documents will be stored in a file whose name is Foundry's UUID. (Obsidian's "Front Matter Title" plugin will show the document's title in Obsidian's note explorer panel)

With this option unchecked, all documents will be stored in a file whose name is the Document's name.

*Using UUID allows for easier (and more unique) linking of links between documents.*

## Handlebars Helpers

The following handlebars helpers are provided as part of the module. They all have a prefix of "EMD" so that they don't conflict with any other handlebars helpers that might already exist in Foundry.

### `{{EMDvalidFilename string}}`

Returns a string containing `string` into a valid filename.

### `{{EMDconvertHtml context string}}`

Returns a string containing the markdown generated by converting the supplied HTML `string`.

### `{{EMDfileConvert filename label_or_size}}`

The file referenced by the string `filename` is saved in the generated ZIP file, and this helper returns a string which contains a markdown-formatted link to that file. `label_or_size` is used in the returned link string.

### `{{EMDitemsOfType items type}}`

Returns a reduced version of `items` which contains only those entries which have a `type` field matching the supplied value `type`.

### `{{EMDtitleCase string}}`

Returns a string made by converting the first letter of each word in `string` to upper case. (using Foundry's titleCase() addition to the String namespace).

## Installation

The module can be installed directly from your Foundry server's module management page.

Alternatively, you can install manually using the link:
